![Ready to ship accessible websites without long-term contracts, proposals or payroll expenses, for a fixed monthly price?](./header.jpg)

I'm Bogdan! I'm the accessibility consultant who helps product owners ship accessible websites without blocking ongoing work.

I have over ten years of experience working in the education and healthcare sectors, with expertise in inclusive design, technology and accessibility on the web.

Imagine you didn't have to worry about:

- âœ… critical accessibility issues in production,
- âœ… cryptic issues in your backlog,
- âœ… how long it takes your team to fix the accessibility issues in it,
- âœ… new accessibility issues a release introduces,
- âœ… costly redesigns and rework, or
- âœ… what all the fancy acronyms mean.

I do this through a monthly subscription that allows us to work together based on the level of support your team needs. I belive this is the most effective way to make progress quickly. By eliminating the friction of changing priorities, debating scope and exchanging proposals, contracts and statements of work, I can help you consistently ship an accessible product.
